# Assignment 2 - Advanced Algorithms

## Description

This assignment focuses on solving the given problem using backtracking, with a focus on efficiency. 

1. Write a program to compute the number of inequivalent regular graphs of degree 3 for a given value of *n* (number of vertices).
   - Start at *n*=4 and increase as high as possible until the program takes longer than 60 minutes to complete.
3. Write a program to estimate the number of nodes at each level of the backtracking search tree for question 1.

For full explanation of effiency, please refer to [`Q1-efficiency-explanation`](./Q1-efficiency-explanation.pdf)

## Technologies Used

- Language: Java (chosen for it's speed over Python)
- Platform: IntelliJ IDE (can be run easily on the Command Line)
