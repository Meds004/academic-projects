# Assignment 1 - Advanced Algorithms

## Description

This assignment focuses on solving the given problems using dynamic programming or greedy algorithms.  
It includes solutions to the following questions:

1. Find the fasted way possible to get from the start to the end, passing through a number of stops along the way. At each step, there are three possible stops to choose from. All steps have associated costs. Solved using dynamic programming.
2. Given a number of tasks and their associated completion time, find the split points to fit the given tasks into the minimum number of shifts given the following constraints:
- Given shift length
- Cost for breaks (time between tasks)
- Cost of only 1 task in a shift
3. Question 1 modified to have no travel times. Prove it can now be modelled as a Matroid and use the general greedy algorithm for matroids to produce an optimal answer.

For full explanations and analysis, please refer to the included report 'a1-answers'.
