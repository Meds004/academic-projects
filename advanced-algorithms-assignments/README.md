# Advanced Algorithms Course - Assignment Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the three assignments from a 4th-year *Advanced Algorithms* course completed as part of my Computer Science degree.

I've omitted the course code and official assignment instructions, as this is a public repository intended for potential employers. Each assignment folder contains a `README.md` file with a brief explanation of the problem(s) addressed.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Used for Assignments 1 and 3
- **Java** - Used for Assignment 2, which involved solving a backtracking problem where performance and efficiency were important considerations

## Course Overview

My final grade in this course was **98%**.

Course components included:
- Three assignments (included in this repository)
- A final project ([see `tetris-bot`](../tetris-bot))
- A project presentation
- A term test
