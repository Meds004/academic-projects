# Tetris Bot

This project was completed as the final project for a 4th-year Advanced Algorithms course.  
I built a custom Tetris game from scratch using **Python** and **Pygame**, along with an AI bot capable of playing the game autonomously.

The bot uses a set of **heuristic functions** to evaluate possible board states and determine the optimal placement for each incoming piece.

The goal of this project was to experiment with heuristic functions using Tetris as the 'playground'.

## Requirements

- Python
- `pygame` (install with `pip install pygame`)
- 1080p monitor (for proper rendering and scaling)

## Demo

Video demo (coming soon):
