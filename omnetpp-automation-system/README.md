# Batch Simulation Runner â€“ Independent Project

This project was completed as part of an undergraduate independent project course. My supervisor and his graduate students conduct research in **Intelligent Transportation Systems**, using simulation software to evaluate the performance of their solutions.

As an undergraduate contributor, my role was to develop an **automation system** that could run batch simulations in parallel and store the results in an organized, reusable format. The goal was to improve the workflow for current and future grad students by significantly reducing the manual overhead of running large-scale experiments.

## Target Simulation Frameworks

The system was designed to integrate with the following tools:

- **OMNeT++**
- **INET**
- **Veins**
- **SUMO**
- **Simu5G**

## Implementation

The batch runner was built in **Python**, and executed simulation workflows via **Bash commands** in a Linux environment.

## Report

For full technical details and evaluation, see the report:

## Result

Final grade for this project: **98%**
